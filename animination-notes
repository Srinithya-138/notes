To animate CSS element

@keyframe myName{
    from{
        font-size:20px;
    }
    to{
        font-size:40px;
    }
}
to use animation we need to use animation properties
animation-name
animation-duration
animation-timing-function
animation-delay
animation-iteration-count:how many times
animation-direction:reverse(to to from),alternate


Animation Shorthand
animation: myName |duration| timingfunction |delay| iterartion count| direction


%in Animation
from:0%
to:100%

for different animation purpose we can use inbetweeen percent
 perspective: 150rem; //we are giving this because of the rotation perspective is used for the parent and the child 
 z-index: 20; /*to overlap the images we are using */
backface-visibility: hidden;/*it basically hides the back part of an element 
-webkit-background-clip:text;/*if we doesnt use this then we cannot see the text and the color we used to display the text*/
 color: transparent;/*this is used to see the text in green color if we doesnt use this we cansee only the black color text i.e normal text)*/
overflow:hidden;//this is used when in an box if we applies border-radius propertyand the image is placed above that we can use overflow hidden then only we can see 
the rounded corner
 to wrork in all the browser we have to use :-webkit-clip-path;
 box-decoration-break:clone;
