hyper text reference 
by clicking we have to go for another web page for that purpose we are using anchor tag <a href="here we have give the link towhich we want to go i.e.,url"target="_blank"></a>
if we want to open in new tab we want to give target=_blank
cascading style sheets
internal we are giving the things in same line itself
property:value
color:value
in internal we are using style tag and inside that we are saying for which we want the change
in css if we give inline and internal the inline takse more priority
*is used as universal selector
<div>it represent division,it will divide</div>
there are generally 3 types of css 
inline
internal
external 
inline example<tagname=property:value>
    eg:<h1 style="background-color: pink;">this is the heading tag with color pink</h1>
    <p style="color:blue">this is the para</p>
INTERNAL example inside the head tag open style tag and write the tag name after that use parenthesis
example:
<head>
    <style>
        h1{
            color:red;
            text-align:center
        }
    </style>
</head>
In external css we need to create an extenal css file without any necessary tag we need only the modifications for which we need the tag properties
h1{
    color:red;
    text-align:center
}then in the main file we need to <link rel="stylesheet" href="here we need to give the saved file name"> then we need to link it
SELECTORS
The selectors will help you to select items accordingly 
if we want to select all item in a paragraph then we need to say p{

} 
Then only if we need the particular items then we have to give the id name
#idname{

}
example<p id="para">here only the item inside this will be affected as we gave the id name</p>
.Dot will say the class name which is to be modified
<p class="center">here if we put dot center then only this particular para will be affected</p>
.center here the center class is modified
if we dont want all the center class then we can modify it using the tag name.class name
if we give the class name with two names then if we call using any one of the name then it will ALSo be modified
 * this will be applicable to  all the tags inside the body tagname 
if we want to give same modification to all tag such as h1,h2,p then we can write it as
h1,h2,p{
    
}

in <div></div> tag if we create 2 div tag if the outer div size will be reflect in the innner div also
padding is the space between the border and content
space between two box i.e between two content of the border is known as margin
<input placeholder="">is used to create a search box
display block it takes full width I.e it takes one line and nothing comes inside and outside
if it is inline it takes only upto the written element size
inline block we can set the size and width and it can starts with the line itself
the div tag by default does not have the height and width so we have to set the height and width
