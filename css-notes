hyper text reference 
by clicking we have to go for another web page for that purpose we are using anchor tag <a href="here we have give the link towhich we want to go i.e.,url"target="_blank"></a>
if we want to open in new tab we want to give target=_blank
cascading style sheets
internal we are giving the things in same line itself
property:value
color:value
in internal we are using style tag and inside that we are saying for which we want the change
in css if we give inline and internal the inline takse more priority
*is used as universal selector
<div>it represent division,it will divide</div>
there are generally 3 types of css 
inline
internal
external 
inline example<tagname=property:value>
    eg:<h1 style="background-color: pink;">this is the heading tag with color pink</h1>
    <p style="color:blue">this is the para</p>
INTERNAL example inside the head tag open style tag and write the tag name after that use parenthesis
example:
<head>
    <style>
        h1{
            color:red;
            text-align:center
        }
    </style>
</head>
In external css we need to create an extenal css file without any necessary tag we need only the modifications for which we need the tag properties
h1{
    color:red;
    text-align:center
}then in the main file we need to <link rel="stylesheet" href="here we need to give the saved file name"> then we need to link it
SELECTORS
The selectors will help you to select items accordingly 
if we want to select all item in a paragraph then we need to say p{

} 
Then only if we need the particular items then we have to give the id name
#idname{

}
example<p id="para">here only the item inside this will be affected as we gave the id name</p>
.Dot will say the class name which is to be modified
<p class="center">here if we put dot center then only this particular para will be affected</p>
.center here the center class is modified
if we dont want all the center class then we can modify it using the tag name.class name
if we give the class name with two names then if we call using any one of the name then it will ALSo be modified
 * this will be applicable to  all the tags inside the body tagname 
if we want to give same modification to all tag such as h1,h2,p then we can write it as
h1,h2,p{
    
}

in <div></div> tag if we create 2 div tag if the outer div size will be reflect in the innner div also
padding is the space between the border and content
space between two box i.e between two content of the border is known as margin
<input placeholder="">is used to create a search box
display block it takes full width I.e it takes one line and nothing comes inside and outside
if it is inline it takes only upto the written element size
inline block we can set the size and width and it can starts with the line itself
visibility none element space is not reserved
visibility hidden space is reserved
the div tag by default does not have the height and width so we have to set the height and width
padding and margin both are used to create space 
if we want space between  border and content then we need padding and occurs inside border
if we want space between border and border then we need margin and occurs outside the border
//border-border :margin
there is also another property outline
//which adds border outline
border:1px solid black;
outline-style:5px solid dotted;
outline offset
//used to add space between border and outline the space betweenthe element is transparent
text decoration
//overline this add line above the text
//underline
//line-through through the text
//overline underline both property of overline and underline 
text transformation
//uppercase all in capital letter
//lowercase all in small letter
//capitalized starting words of each letter is capital
//letter spacing is used to add space between character in a text and this can also be in minus
letter-spacing:-2px;
//text-shadow is used to give the shadow effect on the text
text-shadow:1px 1px 1px black,0 0 25px blue;
//font weight is used to add bold and normal
font-variant :small caps
//by default underline will come for link if we don't want it then we can give
text-decoration:none;
border-radius is used to add the smalldifference in the box small and round the corner in outer border edge
if we give display inline it takes the space  only upto the content and by default margin does not take space in the bottom and top
if we give block then it takes a single line nothing will come before and after
inline-block we can set margin and padding
if we give display none the element will not be displayed and the space is also not reserved 
if we give visibility hidden the element will not be displayed and the space is  reserved  
By default in the web page it has some padding so we have to add the universal selector for padding and margin
by taking the mouse on the letter if we want color change then we have to use hover
l1:hover
then if we want the cursor to be pointer then we have to put
cursor:pointer
if we put text-align center then inline element also changes to center
absolute unit is px this is same
//relative units
%  is used to define a size relative to an element parent object
em depends on the text size and it can be used for parent and child and the font size is multipluied by child  2em(2*font size of parent)
//em can also used for width and it is said to be 5em(5*fontsize of parent)
rem(root em) 
font size of root element
vh view port height 
//height:1vh we can see only 1 percent of  our browser height 
vw view portwidth
//position 
static :default position (no effect on top ,right,left,z-index property)
position:static;
relative it can work for top,bottom etc
absolute works for the parent
