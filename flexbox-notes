Flexible Box Layout is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows or columns.
outer
row is left to right
column is top to bottom
if we give display flex then it become flex Box
//display:flex
flex direction say in which direction the things will be arranging 
*//default direction is:row 
//main axis is horizontal in row
flex-direction:row-reverse ;
//then all the things inside the flex container will be in right to left
flex-direction:column
//main axis is vertical in column
//then it will be in top to bottom  

*FLEX PROPERTIES:
Justify-content:
*flex-start,flex-end,center,space-evenly
//Justify-content:start and end says in which direction the content will be coming (basically in the main axis)
Justify-content:space-evenly gives sapace even on all the sides 
Justify-content:center give the content in the center of the flex box 
//start in which direction the row or column start there will be the item (no change in the direction i>e, the first item will be in the first direction but right or left changes happens)

*ALIGN CONTENT: is applied for our container 
//it says space of the content
//flex-wrap:wrap; wrap is one after another  
it is used for if the content is in multiple line 
if we use align item: center then there will be space in the wrap(i.e space after the first item)
//align-self:alignment of individual item(its priority is higher than the align item)
if the container size is smaller than the inside item then it gets shrink
//flex-shrink
if the container space is bigger then the flex item start to grow relative to the rest of the flex item
//flex-grow
align-item :center is udsed for centering the item in the cross axis direction
