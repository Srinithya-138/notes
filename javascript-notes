 ECMA script is a specification
 js is a programming language
 prompt is used to get the input from user Tthe prompt takes input is in tha form of string if you enrter a number also (if you get number as input the number is a string)
 alert is used to display a alert box in js we can use any arithmetic operation and see the output in the alert box
 script src is used for linking js 
 var,let,cons are variables 
 //rules 
 var name are case sensitive
 keyword (resreved words) is not accepted 
 we can use camelcase (smallName) for larger names ,
 no space and no hypen(-) is allowed 
 only(letters,digits,underscore is allowed _and $ is allowed)
var is old name of naming variables
var:variable name can be re-declared & updated .A global scope variable (in all the codes)
let:variable name cannot be re-declared but can be updated.A block scope variable({
    inside a block
}) 
const:variable name cannot be re-declared or updated.A block scope variable
if we decalre a variable (let name) but not the value if we are trying to console.log ,we get an value undefined in js by default .But it is not used in const 

//datatypes 
primitive(7)
number,string,boolean,undefined,null,BigInt,symbol
non-primitive
objects(arrays,functions) is a collection of different values
inside the object we have the pair of (keyname:value) 
to access the value we have 2 methods
1)obj.keyname
2)obj["keyname"]

if we have a const object we can update the object's key

//operators
arithmetic,modulus,exponentiation
unary operator (increment,decrement)
comparision operators
1) equal to (==)(it checks for value)
2) not equal to (!=)
to check fro data type
1) equal to (===)
2) not equal to (!==)
logical oprators
logical AND(&&)
logical OR( ||)
logical NOT(!)

//conditional statement-to implement some condition
if statement
if else if
ternary //if we want to print in output we have to use the " " console .log

//MDN Docs
switch statement 
prompt is used to store the value from user .

//loops
to execute a piece of code again and again
for loop
infinite loop:a loop that never ends
while loop
while(stopping condition)
do{

}while(condition);
//for-of loop
used fro strings and arrays
for(variable name of string of array variable name){
//this loop takes from starting value and then iterrate itself and goes to the ending value and is not used for objects
}
//for-in loop used frop objecrt and array
for( variable name in objecrt name )
//for each loop is a method 
it is a loop for arrays
syn:nameofarray.forEach(callBackFunctionname)
here callbackfunction is a function to execute for each element in the array


//Strings in js
to create a string(let str=" ")
string lenth is(str.length)
to access a string index(str[index value])
//template literals in js
a way to have embedded expression in strings(special string)
eg:let specialString=`this is template literal` this is used for the objects
this  is used when we want to display the string in the console box and we want that value for the object 
to use the var name we have to use (${var name})
**in template literal if we want a number in the output it becomes string and is not highlighted in the output (in the console box numbers are highlighted)
//string interpolation
to create a string by doing substitution of placeholders
`string text ${expression} string text`//expression is embedded and its value is calculated in the run time
${1+2+3}//6 is the output ,but this 6 is a string if we display the typeof that then we can see that
//escape characters
\n is used for next line
\t -tab space
\t is counted as single character in the string if we display the string length then we can see that

//string methods
these are built-in functions to manipulate a string 
str.UpperCase()
str.LowerCase()
str.trim()//removes white spaces in the starting and end and it will not trim space in between
strings are immutable if we use the above methods then the changes will be creatyed in the new string not in tha old
str.slice(start,end?)//returns part of string and if we write the ending value aas 3it takes as 3-1=2 upto that only it returns
str1.concat(str2)//joins str2 with str1

//arrays
collection of items
if we ask typeof then it will  output as objectsarray is a object in js
arrays are mutable
//looping an array 
used for printing all items in array
we can use for loop,for -of loop also
//array methods
push()-add to end
pop()-delete from end &returns
toString()-converts array to string but the change is not affected in the original array
concta()-joins multiple arrays &returns array
unshift()-used to add item in the front   
shift()-used to delete first item in an array
slice()-returns a piece of index [slice(startindex,endindex)]
//it doesnot change with the original array 
//and the end index what we given is endindex-1 index will be displayed
splice()- change the original array (add,remove,replace)
splice(startindex,delcount,neweel1..) 
//del count will say how many element we wanted to be deleted with starting index if we say 0 then only that index element is deleted and we say 1 that iindex number and near index number is deleted
//if we dont want to add neweel1 then we can close the arrray with delcount if we want then we can add with the comma
//that new element is added to the deleted index place
//if we say only starting index then it will return from the starting to arrindex-1 if we doen not say the delcount and neweel1

//function in js
used to perform specific task ,can be invoked whenever needed
we have to write function defenition and function call 
redundancy-code repetation
in function if we say return and we try to write console.log()after thatretur statement it is not possible 
but if we write console.log before return then it is possible 
function parameters are local variables of function i.e this value is used only inside that {} this bracket (scope)

//arrowfunctions
is used for small work 
variable name =()=>{

}
const functionName=(parameter1,parameter2..)=>{
    //do some work 
}
