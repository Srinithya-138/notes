objects(arrays,functions) is a collection of different values
inside the object we have the pair of (keyname:value) 
to access the value we have 2 methods
1)obj.keyname
2)obj["keyname"]

if we have a const object we can update the object's key

//operators
arithmetic,modulus,exponentiation
unary operator (increment,decrement)
comparision operators
1) equal to (==)(it checks for value)
2) not equal to (!=)
to check fro data type
1) equal to (===)
2) not equal to (!==)
logical oprators
logical AND(&&)
logical OR( ||)
logical NOT(!)

//conditional statement-to implement some condition
