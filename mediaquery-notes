it helps to make our website more responsive (responsive means the way it shows when the screen is larger or smaller)
@media (width:300){
background color:green;
}
  if the width is 300 then the background color changes to green
  @media (max-width:300){
background color:green;
}
the colour of the div is green from 0 to 300

and we can put for inbetween color changes
@media (min-width:200) and (max-width:300){
background color:orange;
} 

upto that only that color we want exceeding such value we want another color then we want pink color we can write as
@media (min-width:300){
background color:green;
}
