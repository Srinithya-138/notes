//FLUID LAYOUT:
allow the web page to adapt to the current viewport height or width 
%vh,%vw is the unit instead of px for element that should be adaptive for viewport
use max-width instead of width

//RESPONSIVE UNITS:
rem unit 
to make it easy to scale the enthire layout down(or up)automatically

//FLEXIBLE IMAGE:
by default image dont scale automatiocally as  we change the viewport 
so we have to use % for image dimension ,together with max-width property


//MEDIA QUERIES:
to change css styles on certain viewport width(called breakpoints)

//LAYOUT TYPES:
Float ,flexbox,css grid

if we use max-width then the width is adjusted according to the width of the phone or lap if the width is reduced then it adjust accordingly
10 px=1 rem;
the trick to center the viewport is margin:0 auto;//the margin of top and bottom is 0 and left and right is auto
//by giving auto the browser sets the margin to center of the web page,this is used for centering the block level element inside the block element.


//not(:last-child) it does the change for all but except the last child
