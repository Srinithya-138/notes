box-sizing:border-box is used to give the correct width and height what we are giving without applying the default value 
,and the content of the element shrink according to width and height what we give
//the default value forbox-sizing is content-box which means it add the padding and width what we give and adjust according to display the content
line height 1.7 means 1.7 times bigger than the predefined line height
image is an inline element so we can put A container to position that image
background-size:cover is used to see the image on all the screen when the window size is smaller or larger
(eg:phone screena and window screen)
background-position:top this shows when we small the window size the top image should not differ it should be stable
background-image:linear-gradient(here we can give the color to the background image)
background-image:linear-gradient(to right,green,light)
//this will show the colour difference from left to right
//clip path-it will  cut 
the path goes in left, right, right bottom, and bottom left->
opacity 0 means we cannot see the color 
if we dont want any change 
0->x and 0->y
in physical markup exception of  the class element ,if we want to style any other element we can use pseudo classes and it can be used to  changes with respect to state changes such as hover
eg:anchor tag
pseudo class is given by
:hover,:active,link,   etc..
