,and the content of the element shrink according to width and height what we give

(eg:phone screena and window screen)
background-position:top this shows when we small the window size the top image should not differ it should be stable
background-image:linear-gradient(here we can give the color to the background image)
background-image:linear-gradient(to right,green,light)
//this will show the colour difference from left to right
//clip path-cut 
the path goes in left, right, right bottom, and bottom left->
opacity 0 means we cannot see the color
