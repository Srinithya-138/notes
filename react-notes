when a html page is loaded the browser creates a DOM like structure 
react is a library for building user interface 
virtual DOM model -just update the new content added(difference ) will go to the server so therre will not be slow down in the web page

it has component->services->route
one way binding 
component can have statae which is an object and it determines how to render and behave 
"App" or "Global" state refers to state that is available to UI 
imported files are written as <name/> this name should be imported
