used to apply 2D & 3D transformation to an element
*ROTATE
transform:rotate(45deg);
//it will not apply for the inside content apply only foe the box
rotation is possible in x,y,z (in 3 direction)
if we give rotate: x 180 deg
then we could not see the box because we have to think about the 3D x axis about to rotate x it is not visible same will be apply for y also but 
in z we can see the box then it will  be 180 degree rotated in the z direction
 * scale: 
 //whether bigger size or smaller size box
 scale(1) samwe state
 scale(2) 2 times bigger
 scale(x,y)
 how much we want the difference in x axis and y axis
 scaleX(2)//width is twice
 scaleY(2)height is twice
 *translate:
//graph in which direction it want to move
  transform:translatex(200px)
  //it move in positive direction of the X axis
  -200 move in -ve side (i.e right to left)
  translate in x and y direction 
  //transform:translate(200px,100px)
  (x,y)
  *skew:
  skew(30 deg)
  two corner will go like stretching
